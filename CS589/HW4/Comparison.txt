FLAML seems to choose fewer long-running trials and thus can run faster than grid search over the same number of trials. 
GRID search is exhaustive over its search space, so it will find the optimal set of hyperparameters over its search space.
FLAML is not exhaustive but it found a good set of hyperparameters faster than GRID search
FLAML did not find as good a set of hyperparameters as grid search
